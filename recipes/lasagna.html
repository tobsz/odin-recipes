  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
    Lasagna, also known as lasagne, is a type of pasta, possibly one of the oldest types, made in very wide, flat
    sheets. The same-named Italian dish is made of stacked layers of lasagna alternating with fillings such as ragù,
    béchamel sauce, vegetables, cheeses, and seasonings and spices.

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>1 pound sweet Italian sausage</li>
    <li>0.75 pound lean ground beef</li>
    <li>0.5 cup minced onion</li>
    <li>2 gloves garlic, crushed</li>
    <li>1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
    <li>2 (6.5 ounce) cans canned tomato sauce</li>
    <li>2 (6 ounce) cans tomato paste</li>
    <li>0.5 cup water</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
    <li>4 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, divided</li>
    <li>1.5 teaspoons dried basil leaves</li>
    <li>1.5 teaspoons salt, divided, or to taste</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
    <li>0.5 teaspoon fennel seeds</li>
    <li>12 lasagna noodles</li>
    <li>16 ounces ricotta cheese</li>
    <li>1 egg</li>
    <li>0.75 pound mozzarella cheese, sliced</li>
    <li>0.75 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>

  <ol>
    <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
    <li>Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium heat until well browned.</li>
    <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley,
      basil, 1 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 1.5 hours,
      stirring occasionally.</li>
    <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes.
      Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water.</li>
    <li>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</li>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 190°C</li>
    <li>To assemble, spread 1.5 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 8x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles
      lengthwise over meat sauce, overlapping slightly. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of
      the mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1.5 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan
      cheese.</li>
    <li>Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking,
      either spray foil with cooking spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes.</li>
    <li>Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
  </ol>
